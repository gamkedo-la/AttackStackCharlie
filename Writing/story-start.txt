Via Jonathan P (Outpost):
- Boy genius Charlie has a sick grandmother
- Charlie builds a homemade flying time machine from household appliances (like Commander Keen's ship in the first game) to fly into the future and find a cure for his grandmother
- While he's jumping around various times/places trying to calibrate his time machine's navigation system, attack drones/robots/creatures from a cross-species time-travel police force (named S.T.A.C.K.?) attack him for time travelling without a license
- The time machine could also 'accidentally' unlock the ability to pass into alternate universes/realities to explain any bizzare/random environments people come up with
- finally, when the player beats the game, Charlie finds what he needs and gets it home to his grandmother to make her better
