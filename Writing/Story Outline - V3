ACT 1 (Around 1-10 slides)

Charlie, a young kid, sits in the hallway of his grandmother's house, visibly sad and melancholy. He gazes into infinity trying not to fall asleep in the middle of the night.
- A nurse is standing next to him. Charlie asks, “I still can't see her?”.
- The nurse replies, “Let's see tomorrow.”
- Charlie looks back at infinity, disappointed.

He falls asleep.
- Black screen
- Suddenly, the door rings - Charlie is awake in an instant. The lights of an ambulance are reflected on the wall.
- Charlie's grandmother is rushed out on a stretcher. Charlie tries to hug her, but the nurses stop him.
- Charlie barely manages to grab her hand, but all he did was take her watch.

Charlie is left in shock, collapsing and crying on his knees on the floor.
- Charlie notices his grandmother's watch, grabs it and inadvertently presses a button.
- FLASH!

Charlie suddenly appears in a spaceship, completely confused and not knowing what to do.
- WHAM! A group of spacecraft with the STACKS sign appear.
- Charlie freezes.
- The ships begin to attack him. Charlie desperately tries to touch buttons.
- BAM! Charlie's ship jumps to another dimension.
- Charlie lands on the first level.
- The ship warns him that the navigation system is damaged and that he has to get parts by damaging the STACKS ships to control the time.


ACT 2 (Around 1-3 slides)

- Charlie fights with the enemies in different levels
- Charlie succeeds in building the ship part


ACT 3 (Around 1-3 slides)

Charlie returns to the past
- Charlie configures the ship
- Charlie gets to hug his grandmother

Notes
- My idea is that Charlie really doesn't know his grandmother's secret, i.e. he discovers the watch by accident in the middle of the impact and interacts with it out of mere unconsciousness - looking for hope. I think it's much more binding that way, that Charlie does everything he can (not knowing if it will work) to embrace her again no matter what.
